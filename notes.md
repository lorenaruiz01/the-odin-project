this is a notes document to test my new keychron keyboard.
it feels a little sensitive and louder than i was hoping. 
also, the keys seem like they take a long time to get to the bottom, but that may be because i've been used to apple's magic keyboard, which is very flat. the keys feel very smooth and almost slippery which i'm not much of a fan of. 
The keys may be louder than i was hoping for. so not actually quiet.
