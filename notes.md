this is a notes document to test my new keychron keyboard.
it feels a little sensitive and louder than i was hoping. 
also, the keys seem like they take a long time to get to the bottom, but that may be because i've been used to apple's magic keyboard, which is very flat. the keys feel very smooth and almost slippery which i'm not much of a fan of. 
The keys may be louder than i was hoping for. so not actually quiet.

still very loud even with the silicone cover this is the sound with the cover

this is the sound without the cover. i honestly like the sound better without the cover. 

the cover does deaden the sound a bit but not enought to make a significant difference. 

i don't really like the feel of the keyboard with the silicone cover on. I also don't like the sound of the keys with the silicone cover on. 

without the cover the keys feel better but it is much louder.
